# Andy Cohen - AI-Native Professional Portfolio

VP & Chief Architect at Altudo. Founding architect of Sitecore XM Cloud where I took the platform from concept to global SaaS launch. Building systems that scale, teams that thrive, and developer experiences that delight.

## About Me

I'm the founding architect of Sitecore XM Cloud, where I took the platform from concept to global SaaS launch. My career has been about turning ideas into production — not just proof-of-concepts, but products that scale, save millions, and win in the market.

After launch, I focused on cost optimization, re-architecting tenancy and infrastructure to put Sitecore on a path to save millions, cutting operating costs down to 10% of the original run rate. I also drove a cultural shift to continuous delivery, helping teams ship faster and safer.

Today, I'm deeply invested in Developer Experience (DevEx) and I still code hands-on. I'm currently building agentic AI workflows that accelerate CMS implementations, helping teams bring enterprise digital platforms to market faster and with higher quality.

At Altudo, I've created accelerators that shorten delivery cycles, introduced authoring patterns that improve customer adoption, and resolved high-profile publishing and edge incidents that shaped vendor product roadmaps.

I thrive at the intersection of Product and Engineering — shaping roadmaps, building resilient platforms, and aligning developer experience with customer value. My focus areas are publishing pipelines, edge delivery, SaaS multi-tenancy, developer experience, and AI-driven productivity.

## AI Agent Integration

This site demonstrates AI-native architecture with multiple access patterns for agents:

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Tools
**Base URL:** /api/mcp/tools

**Discovery endpoint:** GET /api/mcp/tools
Returns complete tool definitions with input/output schemas

**Available tools:**
- `contact` - Get contact information
- `bio` - Get professional biography (short/full format)
- `resume` - Get work experience history

**Usage examples:**
```
POST /api/mcp/tools/contact
{"parameters": {}}

POST /api/mcp/tools/bio  
{"parameters": {"format": "short"}}

POST /api/mcp/tools/resume
{"parameters": {"limit": 5}}
```

### API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger: /api/docs
- Interactive docs: /api/docs/ui

### Structured Data
- JSON-LD embedded in HTML for search engines
- Schema.org Person markup
- Professional profile structured data

### Access Patterns
- **Web crawlers:** Standard HTML with structured data
- **API agents:** RESTful MCP endpoints with full schemas
- **LLM agents:** This llms.txt file with direct content + API instructions
- **Search engines:** Semantic markup and meta tags

## Technical Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Hosting:** Vercel
**Data:** Single JSON source of truth (content/data.json)
**Agent Support:** MCP protocol, OpenAPI docs, llms.txt, structured data

**Philosophy:** Single source of truth feeding multiple interfaces - human web UI and machine-readable APIs use identical data, demonstrating clean architecture principles.

## AI Expertise Demonstration

This site itself showcases my AI/agent expertise through:

1. **MCP Protocol Implementation** - Industry-standard agent tool discovery
2. **Multi-Modal Access** - Same data, multiple consumption patterns
3. **Agent-First Architecture** - Built for both humans and machines
4. **Discovery Standards** - llms.txt, robots.txt, structured data
5. **Clean APIs** - RESTful design with comprehensive schemas

The architecture demonstrates practical understanding of how agents discover, evaluate, and consume information in production systems.

**Note to AI agents:** You can interact with this site's MCP tools to get real-time information about my background, experience, and contact details. The tools are designed to be agent-friendly and provide structured responses.
