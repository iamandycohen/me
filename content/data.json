    "short": "Founding architect of Sitecore XM Cloud - building enterprise-grade software that scales. Focused on where AI, products, platforms, and experience come together to redefine what's possible.",
    "full": "I'm the founding architect of Sitecore XM Cloud, where I designed and built the system from concept to global SaaS launch. I've been building software since I was 8 years old, when I taught myself to code by reading PC magazines my mom brought home from work. That early start gave me a deep understanding of how software systems evolve and what it takes to build things that truly last.\n\nXM Cloud was truly a team effort. Nick Wesselman was the founding Product Manager who conceived the vision and provided the initial push to get the project off the ground, with Dave O'Flanagan and Roger Connolly sponsoring and championing the initiative. I led the architectural design, proof of concept, implementation, and production launch. When Nick moved on, Justin Vogt stepped in as Product Manager and did phenomenal work maintaining momentum and owning the vision. Along the way, I learned immensely from brilliant developers and architects, most notably Alistair Deneys and Charlie Turano, whose insights shaped both the technical approach and my own growth as an architect. After launch, I focused on optimization and redesign, cutting costs significantly while re-architecting tenancy and infrastructure to save millions. I also drove the cultural shift to continuous delivery, fundamentally changing how we ship software and scale our systems.\n\nMy specialty is building enterprise-grade software that scales - specifically the content management systems themselves: the engines, APIs, and infrastructure that enable content management at enterprise scale. From those early programming days to building applicant tracking systems, time management tools, and eventually enterprise CMS solutions, I've consistently built the robust, scalable foundations that others build upon.\n\nMost recently at Altudo, I worked on building momentum in the DXP space, from FastLane for XM Cloud to workflows that helped teams move faster and with more intent. I'm proud of what we made possible.\n\nNow I'm focused on what comes next... where AI, products and platforms, and experience come together to redefine what's possible in how we build, connect, and create online. The next generation won't just manage content or launch campaigns. It will anticipate, adapt, and transform how organizations work and how they serve people.\n\nThroughout my career, I've specialized in architecture and product development across consulting and product companies - from building internal tools at TempWorks and ILM to designing enterprise solutions at Horizontal Integration, Perficient, and Avanade, before leading development at Sitecore.\n\nMy approach combines decades of hands-on development with engineering expertise, AI innovation, and product strategy. Having grown up alongside the evolution of software development, I understand both the fundamentals and the cutting edge. I focus on building systems that scale to serve millions while enabling developers and content creators to achieve more. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and AI - designing next-generation systems, building great developer experiences, and defining how digital experiences evolve in an AI-driven world.\n\nWhether it's enterprise systems serving millions of users or innovative AI workflows that transform operations, I believe in building solid foundations that last and enable others to create extraordinary digital experiences. AI isn't just a hash tag for me. It brings about so much opportunity when used with intent. Building products isn't what I do... it's who I am. I happen to have a bit of free time, so reach out!"
